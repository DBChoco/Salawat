<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/lightMain.png" alt="Main screen of Salawat" width="70%">
</div>

You might have used <a href="https://github.com/DBChoco/Muezzin">Muezzin</a> in the past, Muezzin is powerful and versatile but quite heavy especially for old or low-end machines.
That is why I've decided to write a brand-new application written entirely in Java. The main goal of the app is to make what Muezzin did (highly customizable and elegant prayer times app)
but more efficiently.

For now, if you have a powerful enough computer, I'd suggest you use Muezzin, because it's more stable.

On Salawat you can choose to play an Adhan or not, you can import your own audio file; you can also choose to have a background or not, and import your own.

<!-- How to install -->
## How to install

### Windows
From the  <a href="https://github.com/DBChoco/Salawat/releases/latest"><strong>download page</strong></a>, select the .EXE installer.
Download it and install it. 

You might receive a warning, that is because the app is not signed and I do not have the money to do so. The app is completely safe, you can read through the source code or have a trusted friend do it for you, all the code is <b>Open-Source</b>.

### GNU/Linux

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.dbchoco.Salawat'>

I'm currently working on AUR support. (Snapstore and Flathub: "check")
In the meanwhile you can use the .DEB and TAR.GZ files as an alternative.
